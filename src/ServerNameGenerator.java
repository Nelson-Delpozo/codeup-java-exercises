//Server Name Generator
//
//        We are going to build a server name generator. Create a class inside of src named ServerNameGenerator, and follow the specs below.
//
//        Create two arrays whose elements are strings: one with at least 10 adjectives, another with at least 10 nouns.
//        Create a method that will return a random element from an array of strings.
//        Add a main method, and inside of your main method select and random noun and adjective and hyphenate the combination and display the generated name to the user.
//        Example Output
//
//
//        Here is your server name:
